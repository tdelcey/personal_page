## Bio 

I am an economist specializing in the history of economic thought, with a particular focus on the origins and development of financial economics. More recently, I have also begun exploring the history of economic thought in France.

My research interests include the evolution of methodologies in the history of economics. I contribute to several projects aimed at making historical economic data—such as oral archives and bibliometric datasets—more accessible. I am also involved in the development of new quantitative methods and software tools designed for research in the history of economics.
