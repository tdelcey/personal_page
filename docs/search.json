    "text": "Abstract\nThis article offers a historical analysis of American interwar agricultural economists and their interest in information. Believing that the main problem facing farmers was a lack of information, agricultural economists designed an information policy aiming to produce, format, and disseminate information. Using administrative archives, we analyze the motivations of these economists and the implementation of this policy. We show that the policy was a prerequisite for theoretical discussions on information, and established institutional tools that are still active today, such as the USDA market news service."

Hayek is seen as proposing to understand prices as information conveyer, incorporating information during the process of competition, while EMH is defined as the fact that all information in a market is integrated into assets prices. This paper explains how a lineage between Hayek and the EMH can be illustrated while taking into account these differences. We particularly want to shed light on the homogeneous shift that can be identified in the epistemology of Hayek and the EMH.

I utilize an original database that combines a citation index of Fama’s review from 1970 to 2000 with the specific paragraphs in which Fama is cited. The analysis reveals Fama’s influence beyond financial economics, showing that his work was widely cited in other research programs, including economics, management, marketing, and law. By analyzing the paragraphs that cite Fama, I demonstrate that the efficient market hypothesis was more frequently critically discussed within core finance research, while it was uncritically used by peripheral research programs."

We investigate the interactions, in the 1960s and 1970s, between two research programmes—“rational expectations macroeconomics” (or “new classical macroeconomics”) and the efficient market hypothesis. We uncover the back-and-forth-dialogue between these two research programmes, which took place along the 1970s. We identify Sargent (1972a)’s contribution on the term structure of interest rates (and ensuing debates) as the starting point of this dialogue. We then highlight how rational expectations models reshaped the definition and assessment of the efficient market hypothesis in financial economics."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper investigates the polysemic character of the Efficient Market Hypothesis through a comparison of the contributions of the two authors who introduced this hypothesis in 1965, Eugene Fama and Paul Samuelson. While both had a normative approach, it is argued that the key point distinguishing the two contributions is the expertise developed by each author. Fama interpreted his model to make practical recommendations for investment strategy. Samuelson interpreted his model to discuss and promote a political expertise that would be useful for policymaking such as the Pareto optimality of speculative price or the social benefit of speculation. The second part investigates the context of paper writing. We suggest that two elements are central to explain Fama and Samuelson’s stance. First, the contrasting viewpoints of their research institutions, respectively Chicago and MIT, and second, the position of each author in early financial economics. Finally, we show how their early contrasted stance is consistent with Fama and Samuelson’s opposite reactions to the Efficient Market Hypothesis controversy in the 1980s. In conclusion, we suggest that this opposition between Fama and Samuelson is useful to discuss the early EMH controversy in the 1980s."

This paper studies the origins of foundational ideas of financial economics such as the price spread, the arbitrage, and the interpretation of price as reflecting information. Based on his publications and archival and interview materials, I analyze Holbrook Working’s intellectual journey between the 1920s and 1960s. Working was a leading North American agricultural economist. I show that his pioneering analyzes of futures markets strongly influenced early financial economists, such as Paul Samuelson, Paul Cootner, Hendrick Houthakker, and Lester G. Telser. Working sheds light on a North American view of speculation that contrasted with the British and dominant one."
