## Abstract

This project aims to build a database on Ph.D. in economics in France from 1900 to 2024. The database is based on the information provided by sudoc.fr, these.fr and idref.fr. The database includes information on the Ph.D. title, the date of the defense, the name of the Ph.D. student and the university. The most recent periods also include information on the supervisors and the jury members. The database would be available in csv format and can be used for further research on the history of economics.
